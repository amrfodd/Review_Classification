high adventure best,1
think robert ryans best film portrayed someone like father schizophrenic real lifemy father although never murdered anyone affected second world war made worse,1
humour get get day apt,1
mother brother thiswhen saw robert ryan portraying type man good imitation type individual impressed,1
almost songs cover girl oldfashioned tuneful,0
annoying thing cover girl way rita hayworth put pedestal,0
unfortunately cover girl example hollywood used exploit women financial gain,0
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks every part articulated quite well,1
good cinematography also makes monica bellucci look beautiful,1

interesting premise billy drago always good dangerous nutbag side note id love see drago stephen mchattie lance hendrikson flick together talk raging cheekbones,1
soundtrack terrible either,1
actingeven professionals drago debbie rochonwas terrible directing worse perhaps contributory former dialog chimplike camera work barely tolerable,0
still sets got big oyvey scale,1
yes simplifying things sake brevity really core problems film much going without real fulfilling explanation,0
good jobs quite amusing,1
convoluted plot convince much film watched weird questioning glance,0
let girlfriend talk seeing bad idea hated,0
last minutes movie also bad well,1
bela lugosi totally extraneous intoning odd lines,0
acting decidely wooden though worse period universal b movie,0
like armand assante cable companys summary sounded interesting watched twice already probably,1
believe screenwriter good job tying loose ends,1
score mostly plot,1
say like spoilers want one believe film worth time,1
wow bad film,0
frightening least barely comprehensible,0
plot hang together acting absolutely appalling,0
even good camp value,0
expecting oscar material,0
would iq particularly stupid mollusk see one coming,0
film use word loosely insult moviegoing public,0
someone involved knew string together narrative,0
gets simply nothing lower,0
one watched recently fox movie channel disappointed,0

victor mclaglen even bad brian donlevy almost unrecognizable,0
considering relations screen taylor stanwyck surprising little chemistry screen two,0
premise film ridiculous president us,0
death row scenes entirely unmoving,0
thing worse taylors acting stanwycks singing,0
whatever producer going missed entirely,0
deeply impressed character played,1
knew saw film great things come gifted actor,1
cheap cheerless heist movie poor characterisation lots underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat better tomorrow cheesy clichs thrown abandoned factory ready poorly executed flying judo rolls la john woo,0
even squibs look awful,0
point proceedings look remotely like america,0
plot derivative predictable ending like mercy killing,0
awful dialogue hopeless overacting everyone gets shot top real waste space time,0
uneasy bad movie scared,0
dialogue composed things make little sense,0
minutes footage wasted show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough make teen goth blush almost always olde english sometimes latin may may made words,0
directing sloppy best,0
hackneyed writing certainly made even worse bad directing,0
course acting blah,0
acting whole cast could put scale balanced perfectly overacting underacting,0
finally get ending would great handled competent people jerry falwell,0
